      " Your Guide to Renting Small Party Venues in San Francisco, CA \n",
      "Not everyone feels enthusiastic about huge parties, and that’s more than okay. Having an intimate party for just your close family and friends is a great idea if you want to do something special but keep the celebration low-key.\n",
      "Small parties require less planning than large-scale events, and they are easier on your wallet too. And the best part – you actually get to interact with your guests. Instead of hasty greetings and small talk, you can indulge in a longer conversation and build stronger connections.\n",
      "Whether you’re throwing a small birthday party, hosting a family gathering or organizing a team-building event with your colleagues, San Francisco is filled with fantastic spaces to set the right mood and make the occasion even more special.\n",
      "Why rent a small party venue in San Francisco?\n",
      "Okay, let’s start with why you should rent a cozy venue for your event instead of simply celebrating at home or hosting an office party in the actual office. Of course, choose whatever suits you best; however, there are some strong advantages to booking a small party venue.\n",
      "Change your environment – There’s just something special about getting out of the space you’re used to and changing your environment. Let’s be honest; nobody wants to have an office party in the office. Even when you’re hosting a private event, such as a birthday celebration or an anniversary party, booking one of San Francisco’s intimate party spaces is a great way to make the occasion truly memorable.\n",
      "Don’t worry about the food – One of the best parts of renting a venue for your party is that you won’t have to worry about cooking and serving the food. This will save you the time you would normally spend on looking up recipes, buying the ingredients and preparing the meals. Plus, on the day of the party, you’ll be able to relax, focus on your guests and enjoy being served by someone else. There’s no need to do the dishes after the event, either!\n",
      "Create the perfect mood – Choosing a small party venue with the right atmosphere can take your event to the next level. Perhaps you’d like to book a dimly lit bar or a private dining room at one of San Francisco’s fine restaurants? The city boasts plenty of unique intimate party spaces that’s hard to recreate anywhere else! Just think about what kind of mood you’re going for, then have a look at our listings and pick the perfect space for your small party.\n",
      "How to choose the perfect small party venue in Las Vegas?\n",
      "There are a few important things to consider before renting the ideal space for your intimate celebration. We’ve put together a checklist to guide you through your search.\n",
      "Decide on the budget – One of the most important steps in planning any event is settling the budget. It will be much easier to choose the perfect space for your party once you know what you can afford. You can adjust your price range using Tagvenue’s filters and easily browse venues that fall within your price range.\n",
      "Create your guest list – Consider who you will be inviting to the party and create a guest list. Knowing the estimated number of guests will help you find the right-sized venue. You don’t want to overspend on a space that’s too big for your small gathering; however, make sure that there is enough room to seat everyone comfortably. \n",
      "Set the date – Pick the date of your party. Remember that many popular venues in San Francisco get booked well in advance, so a good rule of thumb is to start planning as early as you can. Another tip is to be flexible with the date and day of the week if you can, as this can sometimes help you get a better deal.\n",
      "Pick the location – Do you have a specific San Francisco area in mind for your small celebration? Would you prefer an indoor or outdoor location? Keep in mind that the place you choose should be easy to get to for your guests. Also, consider things such as parking spaces or wheelchair access if you’re hosting anyone with disabilities.\n",
      "Choose the menu – One of the core elements of any party is – the menu! Decide whether you want to rent a venue that provides in-house catering, use external caterers or organize a potluck. Remember that not all venues allow you to bring your own food and beverages, so read the terms and conditions carefully and check in with your venue manager.\n",
      "Schedule a viewing – Last but not least, once you’ve looked through the listings, compared the offers and picked a few favorites, it’s a good practice to schedule a viewing before you make the final decision. Seeing your chosen venue in person will help you assess the ambiance and determine if it’s the right fit for the occasion.\n",

      " Great low key venue. Super warm and friendly staff. Daniel was great to work with from day 1 and made the planning process so easy especially as we’re not based in San Francisco. All our guests raved about the food and wine choices. The space itself was just the moody sexy wine bar atmosphere that we were looking for to host our welcome party. Very reasonably priced as well. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking to host an event in San Francisco.\n",

      " The location, the view and the amenities were fantastic. They had everything we needed to throw a birthday party with 30 guests. The space is so easy to configure, we had plenty of room for a dancefloor. The kitchen had everything we need such as platters for the charcuterie, wine glasses, plates, silverware, cutting boards, knives, etc. Clean up was so easy and that's what you want after a good party - no sweeping up or doing dishes! Loved the space and will definitely keep it in mind for future events.\n",

      " We had our wedding reception at Elixir and everything about our experience exceeded our expectations. The staff (Nick, Nick, Reggie and the other bartenders) were exceptional. Nick had us try a bunch of cocktails ahead of the event, which they used to create and print a menu. It was a really nice touch! They were also extremely communicative and helpful with the set up, catering, playlist, slideshow, microphone, doorman, and more. The service was fantastic, and we are still receiving rave reviews from our family and friends who attended. I highly recommend this venue to anyone looking to rent a space for an event.\n",

A special kudos to Rahmat who is the best host you can ever ask for. Super kind, accommodating and easy to work with. He allowed catering from an outside vendor, helped with the set up of our DJ console, and graciously attended all our guests while making sure the venue was clean throughout the night. We would definitely host a party again here and even visit the bar regularly!\n",
